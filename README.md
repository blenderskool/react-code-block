### Documentation

You can find the complete documentation at [**react-code-block.netlify.app**](https://react-code-block.netlify.app)

### Why?

**Let's face it, building code blocks is hard!** There are various libraries out there that handle syntax highlighting, but then you realize that you need more than just
syntax highlighting. If you are writing a technical blog or documentation, chances are you need features like line numbers, line highlighting, word highlighting and so on.
Most of the syntax highlighting libraries don't come with this out-of-the-box, so you have to spend time implementing all this by yourself. Or if they do come with these
features, it's incredibly hard to extend and style them according to the way you want it to be.

React Code Block solves all these problems by only providing you with the core functionality without any of the styling. You can compose the primitive components from this
library to build any kind of code block you need.

### How does it work?

React Code Block uses an existing syntax highlighting library under the hood for syntax highlighting. On top of this, it adds
additional features like line numbers, line highlighting, etc. which can be styled through the primitive components this package exposes.
Currently supported syntax highlighted libraries:
- [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)
- [shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/)
